# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive no-code UI dashboard that enables users to visually build, configure, and manage AI agents using the Juspay Agent Framework (JAF). The dashboard will provide an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for creating agents with tools, configuring A2A protocol capabilities, managing sessions, and deploying agents without requiring any coding knowledge.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a non-technical user, I want to create AI agents through a visual interface, so that I can build intelligent automation without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a visual agent builder interface with drag-and-drop capabilities
2. WHEN a user creates a new agent THEN the system SHALL provide form fields for agent name, description, instructions, and model selection
3. WHEN a user selects a model THEN the system SHALL display all available models from the JAF framework with descriptions and capabilities
4. WHEN a user saves an agent configuration THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields and generate the corresponding JAF agent code
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages indicating what needs to be corrected

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add and configure tools for my agents through a visual interface, so that I can extend agent capabilities without coding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is building an agent THEN the system SHALL provide a tool library with pre-built tools (calculator, weather, file operations, etc.)
2. WHEN a user selects a tool THEN the system SHALL display a configuration panel for tool parameters and settings
3. WHEN a user creates a custom tool THEN the system SHALL provide a form-based interface for defining tool name, description, parameters, and execution logic
4. WHEN a user configures tool parameters THEN the system SHALL support all JAF parameter types (string, number, boolean, object, array) with validation
5. WHEN a user adds a tool to an agent THEN the system SHALL automatically update the agent's tool registry and validate compatibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure A2A protocol settings for my agents, so that they can communicate with other agents and systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables A2A protocol THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options for agent cards, skills, and capabilities
2. WHEN a user defines agent skills THEN the system SHALL allow specification of skill ID, name, description, tags, and examples
3. WHEN a user configures agent capabilities THEN the system SHALL provide toggles for streaming, push notifications, and state transition history
4. WHEN a user sets up agent communication THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of supported input/output modes and content types
5. WHEN A2A configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL generate valid agent card JSON and validate against A2A protocol specifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage agent sessions and memory providers through the dashboard, so that I can control how agents store and retrieve conversation history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures an agent THEN the system SHALL provide options to select memory providers (in-memory, Redis, PostgreSQL)
2. WHEN a user selects a memory provider THEN the system SHALL display relevant configuration fields (connection strings, credentials, etc.)
3. WHEN a user manages sessions THEN the system SHALL provide a session browser to view active sessions and conversation history
4. WHEN a user views session details THEN the system SHALL display messages, artifacts, metadata, and session statistics
5. WHEN a user clears session data THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation dialogs and execute the operation safely

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test my agents in real-time through the dashboard, so that I can validate their behavior before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes agent configuration THEN the system SHALL provide a built-in chat interface for testing
2. WHEN a user sends test messages THEN the system SHALL display agent responses with tool calls, handoffs, and state changes
3. WHEN an agent uses tools THEN the system SHALL show tool execution details, parameters, and results in the test interface
4. WHEN errors occur during testing THEN the system SHALL display detailed error information with debugging context
5. WHEN a user tests streaming responses THEN the system SHALL support real-time message streaming with proper event handling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to deploy and manage my agents through the dashboard, so that I can make them available for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is ready to deploy THEN the system SHALL provide deployment options (local server, cloud deployment, A2A server)
2. WHEN a user deploys an agent THEN the system SHALL generate the necessary server configuration and startup scripts
3. WHEN agents are deployed THEN the system SHALL provide monitoring dashboards showing agent usage, performance metrics, and error rates
4. WHEN a user manages deployed agents THEN the system SHALL allow starting, stopping, updating, and scaling agent instances
5. WHEN deployment issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import and export agent configurations, so that I can share agents and maintain version control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user exports an agent THEN the system SHALL generate a complete configuration file including agent definition, tools, and settings
2. WHEN a user imports an agent configuration THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and restore all agent components
3. WHEN importing agents with dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify missing tools or configurations and provide resolution options
4. WHEN exporting multiple agents THEN the system SHALL support bulk export with dependency resolution
5. WHEN version conflicts occur during import THEN the system SHALL provide merge options and conflict resolution interfaces

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extend the dashboard with custom components, so that I can add specialized functionality for specific use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer creates custom tools THEN the system SHALL provide a plugin API for registering new tool types
2. WHEN a developer adds custom UI components THEN the system SHALL support component registration with proper validation
3. WHEN custom components are loaded THEN the system SHALL sandbox their execution and validate their interfaces
4. WHEN plugins are installed THEN the system SHALL provide a plugin manager for enabling, disabling, and updating extensions
5. WHEN plugin errors occur THEN the system SHALL isolate failures and provide detailed error reporting without affecting core functionality

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage user access and permissions for the dashboard, so that I can control who can create and deploy agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator sets up the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide user authentication and role-based access control
2. WHEN users are assigned roles THEN the system SHALL enforce permissions for agent creation, deployment, and management operations
3. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL require appropriate authorization and log all actions
4. WHEN user sessions expire THEN the system SHALL handle authentication gracefully and preserve unsaved work when possible
5. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive logs of user actions and system changes

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to provide intelligent suggestions and validation, so that I can build better agents with guidance and best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures an agent THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent suggestions for tools, models, and configurations based on the agent's purpose
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide contextual help and suggestions for fixing issues
3. WHEN a user builds complex workflows THEN the system SHALL detect potential issues and recommend optimizations
4. WHEN best practices are available THEN the system SHALL display tips and guidance relevant to the current configuration
5. WHEN a user requests help THEN the system SHALL provide contextual documentation and examples for the current feature
